= Using Cmis Content =

== Connecting to the content source ==

* Browse to http://localhost/external-content/admin and login
* Create a new CmisContentSource from the tree on the left menu. Set the
following field values:
** name - Cmis Content
** API Url - The top level URL of your Cmis instance's webscript API. Typically
this is something like http://localhost:8080/alfresco/api/s (there's a publically
accessible Alfresco demo install at http://joomla.demo.alfresco.com/alfresco/s).
** Username - The Cmis instance's username (the public demo system is 'demo')
** Password - The Cmis instance's password (the public demo system is 'demo')
** Root Path - Leave as blank
* Once saved, you will need to reload the External Content page for content to 
start coming through

Be aware that the username and password provided should be a generic 'read-only'
user of the system. Per-user access is on the TODO list.  

== Accessing content on the frontend ==

* Navigate to the "Site Content" tab
* Create a new 'External Content Page' in your site tree
* Change the External Content Source value to the Cmis Content source created
earlier
* Save and view the page on the frontend; its url should look something like
http://path.to.silverstripe/extcon/view?ID=1 or similar
* You can also link to external content directly in the WYSIWYG content areas by
selecting "External Content" as the "Link To" option when the Insert Link toolbar
is displayed

== Importing content == 

* First, make sure you have an empty folder called "Incoming" created in the 
"Files & Images" section
* Navigate back to the External Content section, and expand the "Cmis Content"
node created earlier. 
* Navigate to a folder (eg Data Dictionary/Scripts) and click on its name, then 
click on the Migrate tab.
* Select the "Incoming" folder, then click the "Include Selected Item in Migration" 
option.
* Click the Migrate button down the bottom. An alert box will shortly appear when
the migrate is complete. 
* Navigate to the "Files and Images" section and click the "Incoming" folder.
