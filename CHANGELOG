Version 0.1.0 RC3

* Updates to the way SeaMist parses information to support CMIS 1.0 Draft 4
  in Alfresco 3.2.0 Community R2. Haven't fully genericised things yet, but
  that will be the first thing that's done in 0.2.0... 

Version 0.1.0 RC2
2009-11-26

* Refactored to use an AbstractSeaMistRepository parent class that handles
  most of the CMIS interactions, leaving the child class to implement just the
  login() and getObject() methods. The getObject method will be removed in a 
  later CMIS version once the entityById bit of the standard comes into play
* Have changed the details you must provide for the connector; now, you 
  must provide the 'RepositoryInfoUrl' which is the URL to the getRepository
  webscript (typically /api/repository). Optionally, you can also provide
  the RootNodeUrl, which is the CMIS URL to the root node to restrict access
  to. If this value is NOT set, then the RootFolderId as found in the repository
  info feed will be used instead.  
* Seamist framework now loads up the SeaMistRepositoryInfo object which provides
  overall information about the CMIS server being connected to. This information
  is used for determining the default root node 

Upgrade notes:

* You will need to change the connection details of any existing Alfresco 
  connectors.
